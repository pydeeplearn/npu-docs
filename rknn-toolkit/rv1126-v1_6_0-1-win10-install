rknn-toolkit quick start 1.6.0

  usb driver, the doc says
    ntb interface, usb id 2207 0018, zadig-2.4.exe install WinUSB driver. 
    after installation, USB/NTB Interface shows no exclamation mark.
  found initial loader device on windows device manager: 
        2207/0006 adb interfaces x2 not connected, 
        2207/110B rockusb device x1 connected, and many not connected.
  usb driver, actually see and do: this does not work, cannot connect from PC
    adb interface, usb id 2207 0006, WinUSB v11.0.0.0. 
    use zigdag to downgrade to v6.1.7600.16385
    need reboot in the middle to finish the driver install

  install failed due to protobuf>=3.6.1 on 4.21.0
  fix by installing the versions in user guide later

    pip install tensorflow=1.14.0

  from v1.6.0 user guide: 
  the doc says tensorflow==1.16.3, though will install 1.14.0 later

    pip install protobuf==3.11.2
    pip install numpy==1.16.3 scipy==1.3.0 h5py==2.8.0 networkx==1.11 flatbuffers==1.10
    pip install ply==3.11 requests==2.22.0

  come back to the quick start doc
  tensorboard 1.14.0 requires setuptools>=41.0.0 but you have 40.6.2, despite it installed ok
  the futurize.exe and pasteurize.exe are in ~/AppData/Roaming/Python/Python36/Scripts, which is not on path

    pip install tensorflow==1.14.0
    pip install torch==1.6.0+cpu torchvision==0.7.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html --user
    pip install mxnet==1.5.0


  continue 
  install from local directory rknn-toolkit/packages/required-packages-for-win-python36/

    pip install lmdb-0.95-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

  install from rknn-toolkit/packages/
  it uninstalls requests-2.18.4 lmdb-0.95 and replaces with requests-2.22.0 lmdb-0.93
  the requests-2.18.4 was brought in and required by mxnet-1.5.0

    pip install rknn_toolkit-1.6.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl

  install opencv-python and gluoncv
  install visual studio 17 2022 first so opencv-python 4.6.0.66 can build
  install cmake-3.23.2-windows-x86_64.msi
  still cannot build. try 3.3.0.10 , ok.
  gluoncv 0.11.0. matplotlib 3.3.4 requires pillow>=6.2.0 but you'll have pillow 5.3.0 which is incompatible

    pip install opencv-python==3.3.0.10
    pip install gluoncv

  windows set envrionment so that adb is in the path

    set "PATH=%PATH%;D:\platform-tools_r30.0.3-windows\platform-tools\"


run example

  adb device: c42a5e9c6e88a93
